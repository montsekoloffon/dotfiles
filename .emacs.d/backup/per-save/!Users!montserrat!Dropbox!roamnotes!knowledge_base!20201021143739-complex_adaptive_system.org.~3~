#+title: Complex Adaptive System

* Note to self:
~Jack~ =never talks about "Complex Adaptive Systems", instead he states that systems are:=
1. Constantly changing
2. Tightly coupled
3. Governed by feedback
4. Nonlinear
5. History dependent
6. Self-organizing
7. *Adaptive*
8. Counterintuitive
=He says it is because of these properties that dynamic complexity arises.=

=In contrast,= ~Rosenau~ =states that:=
1. The interrelationships of the agents is what makes them a system.
2. The capacity of the agents to cope collectively with the new challenges is what makes them adaptive systems.
3. The capacity of the agents to break with routines and thus initiate unfamiliar feedback processes is what makes the system complex.
=Furthermore, he specifies that:=
4. In a simple system all the agents consistently act in prescribed ways.X
