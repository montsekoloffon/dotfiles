* Summary
=In this article, ~Rosenau~ correctly identifies the limits of complexity theory. It is important to point out that he is referring to complexity theory alone, and thus he cautions against treating complexity theory as a panacea for instability at the risk of disillusionment. Personally, I suspect that by integrating RCA to the complexity approach (such as ~Jack~ suggests) addresses the limits that ~Rosenau~ identifies.=
* Highlights
** Introduction
- ~Rosenau~ =starts by explaining that he uses the term= [[file:../knowledge_base/20201020180842-fragmentation.org][fragmentation]] =to label= "this emergent epoch [the 90s] of multiple contradictions [...] in order to summarily capture the tensions between the fragmenting and integrating firces that sustain world affairs".
- =The argument of the paper is that= "a [...] discrepancy prevails between our intellectual progress toward gasping the underlying complexity of human systems and our emotional expectation that advances in complexity theory may somehow point the way to policies which can ameliorate the uncertainties inherent in a fragmentative world".
-  =About this, before seeing ~Leo's~ video on systems thinking, I didn't know anything about this approach. I completely resonated with the explanation from the moment I came across it. If I'm not mistaken, I watched that video when it came out, ie. in 2017. Then, I think around winter that year I discovered Thwink.org (also through ~Leo's~ blog) and became obsessed about it. I educated myself further on the application of systems thinking, and it was only until March 2018 that I contacted ~Jack~. To put things in context, in February 2018 I had just been in the UN in a series of events about the SDGs and was growing disappointed in the type of disintegrated and "fragmented" (not in Rosenau's sense) action that was being taken. I have to admit that the major appeal that Thwink.org had for me, was that it was indeed offering a panacea for achieving the SDGs. I want to point out, however, that there is a good reason why I still believe that Thwink.org is offering the most convincing potential panacea (leaving spirituality aside for a moment) for achieving sustainable development. Thwink.org's approach, contrary to what any other complexity scientist out there is doing, is combining the power of system dynamics with Root Cause Analysis, and per definition, a panacea is according to the OLD "that which solves all problems related to a particular situation". I would change the word "problems" for "symptoms", but bottom line, a panacea is that single strategy of only focusing in addressing the root causes, to fix all undesirable symptoms.= 
- Uncertainty since end of Cold War ↑, Analysts seek panaceas for instability ↑, hope in study of complexity theory ↑
- "all the circumstances are in place ofr an eventual disillusionment with complexity theory"
=Rossenau isn't taking RCA into consideration, and thus, he is right when he argues that complexity theory will disappoint if treated as a panacea by analysts. As ~Jack~ once said, without RCA, system dynamics rely on individual brilliance to identify the relevant nodes. Not using RCA leds him to make the observation that complexity theory's...=
- "benefits can be exaggerated and thus disillusioning"
** Uncertainties
- ~Rosenau~ =argues that the Cold War offered a scenario in which the course of events= "was comprehensible, reliable, and continuous". =By contrasts, he suggests that= "today [during the post-Cold War...] uncertaonty is the norm and apprehension the mood. [and] Whatever may be the arrangements that have replaced the bipolarity of US-Soviet rivalry, they are at best incipient structures, and at worst, [...] widespread disarray. [...] Put differently [...] it is an epoch of multiple contradictions".
- ~Rosenau~ =believes= "that we aree deeply immersed in an epochal transformation sustained by a new worldview about the essential nature of human affairs, a new way of thinking about how global politics unfold."
- ~Rosenau~ =attributes as the sources of complexity both= "the absence of a superpower rivalry [but also] Technological dynamics, and [everything that comes with it]"
- "our conceptual equipment needs to be enhanced and refined [...] under some conditions nonlinear approaches are more suitale than the linear conceptual equipment that has served for so long as the asis of analysis, that the disciplinary boundaries that have separated the social sciences from each other and from the hard sciences are no longer clear-cut, and that the route to understanding and sound policy initiatives has to be traversed through interdisciplinary undertakings." =(About this, see ~Gaddis~ 1992).=
- "It is perhaps a measure of this gap between the transformative dynamics and the conceptual equipment available to comprehend them that our vocabulary for understanding the emergent world lags well behind the changes themselves." =I tend to agree, and the UN has contributed to this "complexification" by taking its overly-inclusive approach.=
- "We do not have techniques for analysing the simultameity of events such that the full array of their interconnections and feedack loops are identified." =In mainstream social sciences? no, we don't.=
** Searching for Panaceas
- "it is understandable that both the academic and policy-making communities are vulnerable to seraching for panaceas."
- "officials and thoughtful observers alike may be inclined to seek security through an overall scheme that seems capable of clarifying the challenges posed by the emergent epoch. Complexity theory is compelling in this regard. The very fact that it focuses on complex phenomena and presumes that these are subject to theoretical inquiry, thereby implying that complex systems are patterned and ultimately comprehensible, may encourage undue hope that humankind's prolems can be unravelled and effective policies designed to resolve them pursued." =This is 100% true, and it is in fact what we are seeing, but only because those promises that complexity offers can only be delivered when used /in combination/ with RCA.=
- "Stirring accounts of &The Santa Fe Institute&, where complexity theory was nursed into being through the work of economists, statisticians, computer scientists, mathematicians, biologists, physicists, and political scientists in a prolonged and profoundly successful interdisciplinary collaboration, kindled these hopes."
- =Some literature by authors from the= &Santa Fe Institute& =imply= "that creative persistence is worth the effort in the sense that eventually underlying patterns, a hidden order, are out there waiting to be discovered." =And I do believe this is the case.=
** Strides in Complexity Theory
- Four underpinnings of complexity theory to acknowledge the claims made for it.
- The [[file:../knowledge_base/20201021143739-complex_adaptive_system.org][Complex Adaptive System]]: "Such a system is distinguished by a set of interrelated parts, each one of which is potentially capable of being an autonomous agent that, through acting autonomously, can impact on the others, and all of which either engage in patterned behaviour as they sustain day-to-day routines or break with the routines when new challenges require new responses and new patterns. The interrelationships of the agents is what makes them a system. The capacity of the agents to brbeak with routines and thus initiate unfamiliar feedback processes is what makes the system complex [...]. The capacity of the agents to cope collectively with the new challenges is what makes them adaptive systems."
- The four premises of complexity theory build upon the foregoing conception of a complex adaptive system.
***** Self-Organisation and Emergent Properties
- "The parts or agents of a complex adaptive system, being related to each other sufficiently to form recurrent patterns, do in fact self-organise their patterned behaviour into an orderly whole and, as they do, they begin to acquire new attributes. The essential structures of the system remain intact even as their emergent properties continue to accumulate and mature."
***** Adaptation and Co-evolution
- "In the case of human systems, it is presumed thay are composed of learning entities, with the result that the dynamics of emergence are steered, so to speak, by a capacity for adaptation, by the ability of complex systems to keep their essential structures within acceptable limits. [...] Human systems' adaptive task is to maintain an acceptable balance between their internal needs and the external demands." =I think this is a bit lacking definition, because it only speaks about the human system, when all systems are supposed to work in the same way, but ok.=
- "As systems and their environments become ever more complex, feedback loops proliferate and nonlinear dynamics intensify, with the result that it is not necessarily evident how any system evolves from one stage to another".
- "the processes of evolution do not follow neat and logical steps"
- "Even the most complex system can maintain long equilibria before undegoing new adaptive transformations, or what complexity theorists call'phase transitions'." =This probably refers to mode changes.= "[...] their progression through time can pass through periods of stasis or extremely slow, infinitesimal changes before lurching into a phase transition, therebyb tracing a temporal path referred to as 'punctuated equilibrium'."
***** The Power of Small Events
- "small, seemingly minor events can give rise to large outcomes, [...] sustems are sensitive at any moment in time to the conditions prevailing at that moment and can thus initiate process of change that are substantial and dramatic."
***** Sensitivity to Initial Conditions
- "even the slightest change in initial conditions can lead to very different outcomes for a complex adaptive system."
- "the processes of emergence pass through a number of irreversible choice points that lead down diverse paths and, thus, to diverse otucomes.[...] the power of an altered initial condition can lead to desirable as well as noxious results, an insight that highlights the wisdom of paying close attention to detail in the policy-making process."
** The Limits of Complexity Theory
** The Limits of Complexity Theory
- "Complexity theory [...] cannot [...] anticipate whether a large outcome will occur, or, if it does, the range within which it might fall."
- "there are strict limits within which theorizing based on the premises of complexity theory must be confined. It cannot presently -and is unlikely ever to- provide a method for predicting particular events and specifying the exact shape and nature of developments in the future."
- "it is when our panacean impulses turn us toward complexity theory for guidance in the framing of exact predictions that the policy payoffs are least likely to occur and our disillusionment is most likely to intensify." =This happens bbecause the creation of the models isn't complemented with RCA.=
- "It is not known when or where the nonlinear dimensions will appear and trigger inexplicable feedback mechanisms."
** Theorising Within the Limits
- "if the search for panaceas is abandoned and replaced with a nuanced approach, it quickly becomes clear that the underlying premises of complexity theory have a great deal to offer as a perspective or worldview with which to assess and anticipate the course of events. Perhaps most notably, they challenge prevailing assumptions in both the academic and policy-making communities that political, economic, and social relationships adhere to patterns traced by linear regressions." =This is the black box vs. glass box approach.=
- "A complexity perspective [...] is a mental set [...] that does not specify particular outcomes or solutions but that offers guidelines and lever points that analysts and policy makers alike can employ to more clearly assess the specific problems they seek to comprehend or resolve." =This is important: one thing is properly diagnosing the disease by clearly understanding the functioning of the system, and a different one is designing the adequate medicine to remedy it. Of course, the latter is much easier when we understand the former, so while the two are separate and different processes, the first one is necessary for the second one to be effective.=
- "The first obbstacle to adopting a complexity perspective is to recovnise that inevitably we operate with some kind of theory. It is sheer myth to believe that we need to merely observe the circumstances of a situation in order to understand them. Facts do not speak for themselves; observers give them voicey sorting out those that are relevant from those that are irrelevant and, in so doing, they bring a theoretical perspective to bear."
- "the inability of complexity theory to make specific predictions is not a serious drawback. Understanding and not prediction is the task of theory."
