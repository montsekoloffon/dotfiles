#+title: Complex Adaptive System

* Note to self:
~Jack~ =never talks about "Complex Adaptive Systems", instead he states that systems are:=
1. Constantly changing
2. Tightly coupled
3. Governed by feedback
4. Nonlinear
5. History dependent
6. Self-organizing
7. *Adaptive*
8. Counterintuitive
=He says it is because of these properties that dynamic complexity arises.=
